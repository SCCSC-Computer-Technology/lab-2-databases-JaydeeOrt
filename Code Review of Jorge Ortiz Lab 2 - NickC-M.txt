Code Review of Jorge Ortiz Lab 2

Nicholas Chapman-Miller

	Code compiles without any issues/errors/warnings. Code is very simple and clean. Lacking documentation although it would be pretty short if it was there since all the buttons are one line of code. 

	Could not find any crashes/bugs/exceptions while using all the controls, which is great! The only button with a shortcut is exit though so the rest of the buttons need a shortcut. 

	My solution was very similar to yours although one thing you did differently was the way you showed the results for highest/lowest population. I put the result of a query in a Messagebox while your query updated the table to show the specific record that has the highest/lowest population. I like your way of displaying the result better as it looks much cleaner and shows the specific city. Great code and form!!!
